# Structur-factor
Structur factor of rod for light scattering experiment

This very short code is to calculate rodlike structure factor to fit with light scattering experiment.
It is purposely very simple to be easily adjustable with any code and/or to be used by fairly experienced coders.

You can change the radius (R) and the lenght (L) of the rod within the code (line ~50), so as the limits of the wave vectors (q0 and qn).
The actual example is for light scattering using D:10nm and L:700nm. It will show a graph and save data in autosave.csv ("." as decimal and ";" as separator).

Package needed to run SqRodOnly.py are matplotlib, numpy, csv and scipy.

The equation was taken from "Form and Structure Factors:Modeling and Interactions" of Jan Skov Pedersen, University of Aarhus, Denmark (pdf online). Thanks to him.

Enjoy and comment if you find issue/mistake or want to improve it.
